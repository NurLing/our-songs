        <h1>Galway Girl</h1>
        <h2>Ed Sheeran</h2>
		
            <p>She played the fiddle in an Irish band<br>But she fell in love with an English man<br>Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand<br>Said, "baby, I just want to dance"<br></p>
            <p>I meet her on Grafton street right outside of the bar<br>She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar<br>She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
			<br>Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
			<br>She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
			<br>But I had other dreams instead<br>She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding as a shotgun
			<br>Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
			<br>Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
            <br></p>
			
            <p>You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
			<br>But she fell in love with an English man
			<br>Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
			<br>Said, "baby, I just want to dance"
			<br>With my pretty little Galway girl
			<br>You're my pretty little Galway girl
			<br></p>
			
            <p>You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
			<br>And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
			<br>As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
			<br>After dancing to Kaleigh, singing to trad tunes
			<br>I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet
			<br>A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat
			<br>Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
			<br>And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
			<br></p>
			
            <p>And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
			<br>I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
			<br>Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
			<br>As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
			<br>I walked her home then she took me inside
			<br>To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
			<br>I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
			<br>About a Galway girl and a perfect night
			<br></p>
